# DissonanceFusionSharedMode

This plugin is a extended version of the already existing Dissonance Photon Fusion integration that allows Fusion's largely used "Shared Mode" to function along with Dissonance since Dissonance does NOT support Shared Mode out of the Box.

Versions for both Fusion 1 and 2 are available.
